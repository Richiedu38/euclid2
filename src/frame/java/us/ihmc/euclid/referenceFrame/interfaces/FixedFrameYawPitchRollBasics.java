/**
 * Write and read interface for a yaw-pitch-roll object expressed in a constant reference frame,
 * i.e. the reference frame of this object cannot be changed via this interface.
 * <p>
 * In addition to representing a {@link YawPitchRollBasics}, a {@link ReferenceFrame} is associated
 * to a {@code FixedFrameYawPitchRollBasics}. This allows, for instance, to enforce, at runtime,
 * that operations on yaw-pitch-rolls occur in the same coordinate system. Also, via the method
 * {@link FrameChangeable#changeFrame(ReferenceFrame)}, one can easily calculates the value of a
 * yaw-pitch-roll in different reference frames.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because a {@code FixedFrameYawPitchRollBasics} extends {@code YawPitchRollBasics}, it is
 * compatible with methods only requiring {@code YawPitchRollBasics}. However, these methods do NOT
 * assert that the operation occur in the proper coordinate system. Use this feature carefully and
 * always prefer using methods requiring {@code FixedFrameYawPitchRollBasics}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Equivalent representation of yaw-pitch-roll as 3-by-3 rotation matrix:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     / cos(yaw) -sin(yaw) 0 \   /  cos(pitch) 0 sin(pitch) \   / 1     0          0     \
 * R = | sin(yaw)  cos(yaw) 0 | * |      0      1     0      | * | 0 cos(roll) -sin(roll) |
 *     \    0         0     1 /   \ -sin(pitch) 0 cos(pitch) /   \ 0 sin(roll)  cos(roll) /
 * </pre>
 * </p>
